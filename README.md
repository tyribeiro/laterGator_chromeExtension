# laterGator_chromeExtension

This project was my attempt at creating a chrome extension to help me with college. I found that I was spending way too much time copying and pasting links into a word document to have access to them later when studying.

As a solution, I created this chrome extension so that I can automatically save the tab/url I was currently working on in a fast and easy way. 

Because I utilized local storage, the links will always be there until I delete them.
